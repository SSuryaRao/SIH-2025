# ðŸŽ¯ SIH 2025 Backend - Digital Career Guidance Platform

Node.js + Express + Firebase backend API for the Digital Guidance Platform.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
For development, use firebase-service-account.json file.
For production (Render), set these environment variables:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Firestore Database in your Firebase project
3. Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
4. Generate a new private key and download the JSON file
5. Rename the downloaded file to `firebase-service-account.json`
6. Place this file in the `backend/` directory (it's already in .gitignore)

### Firestore Collections Setup
After setting up Firebase, you need to create and seed the required Firestore collections. Create the following collections in your Firestore console:

#### 1. Create `courses` collection
Add documents with the following structure:
```json
{
  "course": "B.A.",
  "careers": ["Civil Services", "Journalism", "Teaching", "NGO Sector"],
  "higherStudies": ["M.A.", "B.Ed.", "PhD"]
}
```

#### 2. Create `colleges` collection
Add documents with the following structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Government Science College",
  "location": "Bhubaneswar, Odisha",
  "latitude": 20.2961,
  "longitude": 85.8245,
  "courses": ["B.Sc.", "M.Sc."],
  "facilities": ["Hostel", "Library", "Internet"]
}
```

#### 3. Create `timeline` collection
Add documents with the following structure:
```json
{
  "title": "B.Sc. Admission 2025",
  "date": "2025-06-15",
  "type": "admission"
}
```

### Installation
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure `firebase-service-account.json` is in the backend directory

4. Set up Firestore collections by running the seed script:
   ```bash
   node seedFirestore.js
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing the Health Endpoint

Test the health endpoint with curl:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

Expected response format:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "time": "2025-09-20T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

## Authentication Endpoints

### Register a new user
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "Registered successfully"
}
```

### Login with credentials
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJhbGljZSIsImlhdCI6MTY5NTIwMDAwMCwiZXhwIjoxNjk1MjAzNjAwfQ.example_jwt_token_here"
}
```

## Quiz Endpoints

### Get quiz questions
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/quiz/questions
```

Expected response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Which activity do you enjoy most?",
    "options": [
      { "value": "science", "label": "Solving math/science problems" },
      { "value": "arts", "label": "Reading literature / creative writing" },
      { "value": "commerce", "label": "Managing money or business ideas" },
      { "value": "vocational", "label": "Working with hands / practical skills" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Submit quiz answers
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/quiz/submit -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"answers":["science","science","arts"]}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "recommendedStream": "science",
  "scores": {
    "science": 2,
    "arts": 1,
    "commerce": 0,
    "vocational": 0
  }
}
```

**Note:** Quiz results are persisted to Firestore when submitted with Authorization header:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/quiz/submit -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" -d '{"answers":["science","science","arts"]}'
```
When a valid JWT token is provided, the quiz result is saved to the user's Firestore document under the `quizResult` field and can be retrieved via the profile endpoint. Results persist across server restarts and user sessions.
